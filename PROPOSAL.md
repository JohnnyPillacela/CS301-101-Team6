# <div align="center"> Facial Recognition with OpenCV

<div align="center"> The problem we will be investigating gets solved with Facial Recognition due to its many implications. It is interesting because with this advanced technology it can help with law enforcement to catch criminals in a world with an abundance of CCTV availability and monitoring. The data we will be using are images for the algorithm to read and learn to effectively mark key facial features a human would have. Since this system will be operating during a live video demonstration, it will be constantly fed images and data from the camera recording the face. Computer Vision uses various machine learning algorithms to achieve different things. OpenCV provides a module called ml that has many machine learning algorithms bundled into it. Some of the algorithms include Bayes Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and so on. We plan on using the best algorithm for what we need which we will find out as we do more research. We can evaluate our results by how fast our system can recognize faces or how well it can recognize a face at different angles depending on how many angles of imagery we have taught it to understand. We can make plots and figures to chart the speed and accuracy of our findings. We can do that by making tests to see how our system reacts and works.
