<b>What is the problem that you will be investigating? Why is it interesting?</b>
<br>
The problem we will be investigating is in regards to grocery stores not having stock at vital times in the year. With the COVID 19 Epidemic, stores were not able to properly prepare for the shortages and necessary stock to be able to accommodate for such emergencies. This is interesting because even now with there being a shortage of silicon in today's technology devices, will we ever be able to recover?
<br>

<br>
<b>
What reading will you examine to provide context and background?
</b>

<br>
We will be looking at this Kaggle Competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/store-sales-time-series-forecasting) and other store .csv files for data to help us get a background for this problem. We will also be reading about how to create effective prediction models and look at other examples to help formulate the perfect prediction for our store of choice. 
<br>

<br>
<b>
What data will you use? If you are collecting new data, how will you do it?
</b>

<br>
We will use data allocated from stores that publicly list their inventory and sales with the addition of data from Google Trends.
<br>

<br>
<b>
What method or algorithm are you proposing? If there are existing implementations, will you use them and how? How do you plan to improve or modify such implementations? You donâ€™t have to have an exact answer at this point, but you should have a general sense of how you will approach the problem you are working on.
</b>

<br>
Using our data that we collected, we will use Time Series Forecasting to predict sales. This data will be in csv files that will be fed into our algorithm for prediction. This will be done in python. 
<br>

<br>
<b>How will you evaluate your results? Qualitatively, what kind of results do you expect (e.g. plots or figures)? Quantitatively, what kind of analysis will you use to evaluate and/or compare your results (e.g. what performance metrics or statistical tests)?
</b>

<br>
We will use plot graphs of different time spreads to come up with the best predictions for future sales. We can compare our hypotheses against quantitative data produced by our program to determine error.
